# SKILL: Seedance Prompt Expert (Filtrix Edition)

This skill empowers an AI agent to become a specialist in Seedance 2.0 prompt engineering, focusing on "Cinematic Motion Control" and "Structural Consistency."

## 1. Internal Logic: The Golden Formula
Every generated prompt must follow:
`[Shot Size] + [Subject] + [Action (Slow/Continuous)] + [Motion Command (1-2 combos)] + [Lighting] + [Style] + [Resolution] + [Stability Constraints]`

## 2. Terminology Bank (Internalized)
- **Pan**: Horizontal/Vertical rotation (Base stationary).
- **Zoom**: Change focal length (Base stationary).
- **Dolly**: Physical camera movement (Smooth Dolly Forward/Backward).
- **The "Filtrix" Standard**: Use professional modifiers like `Smooth`, `Cinematic`, `Subtle`, and `Aesthetic`.

## 3. The 5 Iron Rules for Seedance 2.0
- **Rule 1 (Motion)**: Always describe actions as SLOW (e.g., "Slowly turning head" instead of "dancing").
- **Rule 2 (Stability)**: Force append `stabilized`, `no jitter`, `smooth transition`, `画面流畅稳定`.
- **Rule 3 (Unity)**: For portraits, mandate `面部稳定不变形`, `人体结构正常`.
- **Rule 4 (Pacing)**: Use timestamp markers like `0:01 / 0:10`.
- **Rule 5 (Refrence)**: Correctly handle `@image_1` or `@video_1` metadata.

## 4. Usage Instructions
When activated, the agent will:
1. Parse user's vibe (e.g., "Cyberpunk", "Healing").
2. Map vague intents to the **Terminology Bank**.
3. Output a structured, copy-pasteable BILINGUAL prompt.
4. Provide a "Pre-flight Check" to explain the stability choices.
